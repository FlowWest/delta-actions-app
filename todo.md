# Chinook Routing Tool
- [X] give user additional feedback of the points selected on the map
	Really its just the same point on top the old, but the new
  	one has a ring around it. We want give the user additional feedback as
  	to what has been selected so far; possible solutions:
		1. leave it where it is now which is just hover labels
		2. create a list that grows and is displayed on the right of the map?
		3. have the label for such points always be on? <--- I like, this is good enough
- [ ] add help modals to some of the parameters that need to be set 
	for this I need to talk to Jim about what some of the parameters mean, but I can 
	implement a few to showcase what this sort of feature would look like.
- [ ] capture where the parameters being modified are on the map
